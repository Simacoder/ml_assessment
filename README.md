### 6. **Feature Engineering**
Creates new features to improve model performance:
- **TotalSF** = TotalBsmtSF + 1stFlrSF + 2ndFlrSF (total square footage)

Applied consistently to both training and test datasets.

### 7. **Categorical Encoding**
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Feature alignment between training and test data
- Handling missing categories in test set
- Drop first category to avoid multicollinearity

Trains 3 regression models:

#### Linear Regression
- Train R²: 0.9753 | Val R²: -0.0660 | RMSE: $90,423

- Best performance, minimal overfitting, most accurate

### 9. **Test Predictions**
- Generates predictions for 1,459 test properties
- Creates `predictions.csv` for Kaggle submission
- Shows prediction statistics (mean, min, max)

### 10. **Key Insights & Conclusions**
